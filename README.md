## Live chat:
[![Slack](http://catblock-slackin.herokuapp.com/badge.svg)](http://catblock-slackin.herokuapp.com)

We have two live chat systems. We use Slack a lot - make an account at <http://catblock-slackin.herokuapp.com> and log in at <https://catblock.slack.com>. We are less active on, but still around on, IRC. Join us using #catblock on Freenode.net. You can ask questions there (the main contributors are all in Europe, so anyone in Australia should expect a bit of a wait).

If you want to contribute any improvements, please go ahead and send us a pull request from a fork of this repo!
