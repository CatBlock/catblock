## Overview
CatBlock (previously known as "AdBlock with CatBlock") is like an ad blocking extension, but instead of blocking ads it shows you pictures of cats by default (configurable).

You can also disable replacing ads by cats, so CatBlock can work as a standard ad blocking extension (useful for when you're doing presentations anywhere!)

If you want to find out the history of this extension, you can check it out [here](https://github.com/CatBlock/catblock/wiki/History).

## Goals
This project aims at maintaining and improving the original [CatBlock](http://catblock.getadblock.com) project by Michael Gundlach (the creator of [AdBlock](https://getadblock.com) and CatBlock), which is built on top of the AdBlock code.

AdBlock has recently switched to the Adblock Plus codebase in version 3.0, but instead of importing those changes to CatBlock, we think it would be better to improve the original codebase.

## Installation
CatBlock is available in [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/catblock/mdcgnhlfpnbeieiiccmebgkfdebafodo),
[Opera Extensions Store](https://addons.opera.com/sk/extensions/details/catblock/?display=en) and [Firefox Addons Store](https://addons.mozilla.org/en/firefox/addon/adblock-with-catblock/).

Right now, CatBlock is not available in the [Safari Extensions Store](https://safari-extensions.apple.com), or in the [Windows Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-apps), but we are looking into releasing CatBlock there as well!

If you can't wait for an official release of CatBlock on Windows Store, [find out](https://github.com/CatBlock/catblock/wiki/Building-the-extension#in-microsoft-edge) how to sideload CatBlock on Edge right now.

## Supported browsers
CatBlock is compatible with following browsers:
- Chrome: 49+
- Opera: 35+
- Safari: 6+
- Firefox: 48+
- Edge: Windows 10 Anniversary - version 1607

## Tools we use
We use many different services to help keep CatBlock working! We use [Travis](http://travis-ci.org) to build new versions automatically for us.

We also have Travis connected to [BrowserStack](http://browserstack.com), to run a few automated unit tests for us. If "builds:passing" shows at the top of this README, then it's probably working fine, otherwise the current version of the code might not work so well.
