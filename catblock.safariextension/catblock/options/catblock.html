    <h2>Want your cat to be famous?</h2>
    Send me pictures of your cats and they may end up in CatBlock for <b>everyone</b> to see!<br/><br/>

    The rules:
    <ol>
      <li>Please save them as high-quality <b>JPG</b>s about <b>1024px</b> on the longest edge.
      <li>I'll use the filename for the <b>text to show users</b> when they hover over the photo.  For example, to show "Felix asleep", name it "Felix asleep.jpg".
      <li><b>Crop your photo</b> pretty close to your cat's body or face, so that even if it replaces a small ad your photo will look good on a web page.
      <li>No more than <b>2</b> photos, please!</li>
      <li>Email them to <b>adblockforchrome+catblockpix@gmail.com</b>.
    </ol>

    Love,<br/>
    Michael.
    <br/><br/>
    <i>(Legal mumbo jumbo: by sending me the photo, you are agreeing to let me do whatever I want with it, including publish it on the internet without credit.<br/>
      If I choose not to use your photo, you promise not to get really angry.)</i>
