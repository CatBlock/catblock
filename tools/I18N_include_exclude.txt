This file contains all required I18N strings that could not be detected. These
have to be hard-coded. 
Examples:
  The strings are built up as variables, like translate("filter" + filterid)
  The strings are no longer used but may be again later, like "betalabel"
  The strings are used outside the extension

The syntax is very easy. Start a line with a + and it will include this as if it
was detected in AdBlock's source code. Start a line with a - and it will not report
that string as a missing string (as if it was in the JSON files).

The texts from manifest.json are not scanned

Keep these for future use
+betalabel
+close
+loading

The filter list ids are appended by JS, and as this isn't a javascript parser,
these have to be hard-coded too...
